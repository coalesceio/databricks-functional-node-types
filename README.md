## Functional Node Types

The Coalesce Functional Node Types Package includes:

* [Date Dimension](#date-dimension)
* [Unpivot](#Unpivot)
* [Code](#code)

---

## Date Dimension

The Coalesce Date Dimension Table provides a comprehensive breakdown of date-related attributes, enabling efficient handling of date operations across various
use cases. The table typically includes columns such as day, month, year, day of the week, week of the year, quarter, and flags like day is weekday
or weekend. Additional columns like fiscal year, fiscal quarter, holiday indicators can also be included, depending on the requirements.

### Date Dimension Node Configuration

The Date Dimension node type has two configuration groups:

* [Node Properties](#date-dimension-node-properties)
* [Options](#date-options)
* [Additional options](#additional-options)

### Date Dimension Joins

Join conditions and other clauses can be specified in the join space next to mapping of columns in the UI.

![work_join](https://github.com/coalesceio/Coalesce-Base-Node-Types---Advanced-Deploy/assets/7216836/7acff10b-8845-4c44-851a-b7a0bc7eaf41)

> ðŸ“˜ **Specify Group by and Order by Clauses**
>
> Best Practice is to specify group by and order by clauses in this space if you are not opting for the group by all and order by provided in OPTIONS config.

### Date Dimension Deployment

#### Date Dimension Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Date node of materialization type table or view will execute the below stage:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Create Date Table** | This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a table in the target environment |
| **Create Date View** | This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a view in the target environment |

#### Date Dimension Redeployment

After the Date node with materialization type table/view has been deployed for the first time into a target environment, subsequent deployments may result in either altering the Date Table/view or recreating the Date table/view.

#### Altering the Date Table 

A few types of column or table changes will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Persistent Table in the target environment, whether these changes are made individually or all together:

1. Changing table names
2. Dropping existing columns
3. Altering column data types
4. Adding new columns

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Rename Table/ Alter Column/ Delete Column/ Add Column/Edit table description** | Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation |

#### Date Dimension Recreating the Views

The subsequent deployment of Date node of materialization type view with changes in view definition, adding table description or renaming view results in deleting the existing view and recreating the view.

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Create View** | Creates a new view with updated definition |

#### Date Dimension Drop and Recreate View/Table/Transient Table

| **Change** | **Stages Executed** |
|------------|-------------------|
| **View to table** |  Drop view <br/> Create or Replace Date table/transient table |
| **Table to View** |  Drop table/transient table<br/> Create Date view |

> ðŸ“˜ **Materialization Date Dimension**
>
> When the materialization type of Date node is changed from table to View and use Override Create SQL for view creation. This ensures that the following change is made in the stage function in Create SQL tab so that the order of deployment is maintained.

![CreateSQL](https://github.com/coalesceio/Coalesce-Base-Node-Types---Advanced-Deploy/assets/7216836/0296abf8-0747-4ae8-8478-0782e5e2e545)

### Redeployment with no changes 

If the nodes are redeployed with no changes compared to previous deployment,then no stages are executed

### Date Dimension Deploy Undeployment

If a Date Dimension Node of materialization type table/view are deleted from a Datespace, that Datespace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the DateTable in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in below stage:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Drop table/view** | Removes the table or view from the environment |

## Unpivot

The [Unpivot node](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/unpivot#examples) in Coalesce rotates a table by transforming columns into rows. 
UNPIVOT is not exactly the reverse of PIVOT because it cannot undo aggregations made by PIVOT.

This operator can be used to transform a wide table (e.g. empid, jan_sales, feb_sales, mar_sales) into a narrower table (e.g. empid, month, sales).

### Unpivot limitations

* It cannot reverse aggregations performed by PIVOT
* It requires that all columns have the same data type.In case if the columns from source have diffrent data types,ensure the data types are type casted in an upstream node before adding a UNPIVOT node.
* UNPIVOT cannot be used in dynamic tables or stored procedures
* Ensure that your data is structured and formatted correctly, as any inconsistencies may affect the unpivoting process. It's important to check for any missing values, duplicate entries, or data types that are not compatible with the unpivot function.

### Unpivot Node Configuration

Unpivot has three configuration groups: 

* [Node Properties](#unpivot-node-properties)
* [General Options](#unpivot-general-options)
* [Unpivot Options](#unpivot-options)

#### Unpivot Node Properties

| **Property** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Storage Location** | (Required) Storage Location where the Pivot Table will be created |
| **Node Type** | (Required) Name of template used to create node objects |
| **Description** | A description of the node's purpose |
| **Deploy Enabled** | If TRUE the node will be deployed/redeployed when changes are detected<br/>If FALSE the node will not be deployed or will be dropped during redeployment |

#### Unpivot general Options

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e607c04-f5c8-40ed-8da8-018a5455f520)

| **Options** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Create As** | Choose 'table', 'view' |
| **Truncate** | True/False toggle to enable or disable truncating the output columns |
| **Enable tests** | Toggle: True/False<br/>Determines if tests are enabled |

#### Unpivot Options

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d4e9ae-8da3-46cf-b6bf-37ff693c8fa9)

| **Options** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Infer structure of Pivot table** | Toggle: True/False<br/> True,it is the first run and the pivot table structure is yet to be determined.False,when the pivot table is created and generated columns have been Re-synced in Coalesce|
| **Value-Coulmn** |Column that will hold the values from the unpivoted columns |
| **Name-column** | Column that will hold the names of the unpivoted columns  |
| **Column-list**| The names of the columns in the source table or subquery that will be rotated into a single pivot column|
| **Include NULLS**| Specifies whether to include or exclude rows with NULLs|

### Unpivot node Usage

* Add a Unpivot node on top of source node
* Add the Unpivot column list ,value column,name column in config
* When you choose the Unpivot and value dropdown,ensure that the textbox alongside the dropdown is entered with Column name.This textBox information is required once the Unpivot table structure is synced into Coalesce.
* The toggle 'Infer Structure of Unpivot Data' is required to be true when the node is created for the first time.
* The toggle 'Single value column' is set to false, if you want a multi-dimensional Unpivot
* Once the Unpivot table is created,the 'Re-Sync Columns' can be used to sync the structure of Unpivot table into Coalesce mapping grid.
* After Re-sync,recreate the table with 'Infer Structure of Unpivot Data' set to false
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79282085-e9b7-41e1-8bd2-68fdf98eeb00)
* If the above works, it should be deployable as is. Deploy will simply take the columns and execute a create table.
* Hit run to insert data into table keeping the 'Infer Structure of Pivot Data' set to false

#### Unpivot Initial Deployment

### Points to note for deployment
* Create table with â€˜Infer UNPIVOT structureâ€™ toggle enabled
* Re-Sync columns to the mapping grid
* Deploy with â€˜Infer UNPIVOT structureâ€™ toggle set to false
* Repeat the above steps if you see changes in column of table during redeployment.It is fine to skip for change in materialization type,change in target location or change in node name
* Ensure the new columns added or dropped are part of the inferred UNPIVOT structure and not added/dropped directly in the mapping grid.The deployment will succeed but insert will fail

> ðŸ“˜ **Deployment**
>
> Ensure 'Infer Unpivot structure' set to false before deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Unpivot node of materialization type table or view will execute the below stage:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
